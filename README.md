This is an easy to set up expert advisor for your MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5 platform. You are able to purchase either the expert advisor file or source code from either platform. In order to purchase the Forex Signal Provider, please reach out to me via email at ogunjobiforex@gmail.com inquiring about which item you want to purchase. The pricing for the offered packages are below:

|Item  | Price |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| MT4 Expert Advisor (.EX4 file) OR MT5 Expert Advisor (.EX5 file)  | $200 |
| MT4 Source Code (.MQ4 file) OR MT5 Source Code (.MQ5 file) | $275 |
| Both MT4 & MT5 Expert Advisor | $350 |
| Both MT4 & MT5 Source Code | $500 |

# Set up

1. After purchase of either the expert advisor or source code, navigate to either MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5 desktop software
2. Go to Tools -> Options
3. Enable **"Allow Automated Trading"**
4. Enable **"Allow WebRequest for Listed URL"** and enter "https://discord.com/api" as an allowed URL
5. Go to File -> Open Data Folder -> MQL4 / MQL5 -> Experts
6. Paste either the Expert Advisor File or Source Code File in this folder
7. In the MetaTrader navigator, refresh the advisors folder
8. Drag the expert advisor onto any chart of a forex pair
9. Enter your Discord Webhook found in your server into the **"Discord Webhook Entry"** variable

**Note:** This expert advisor will only work when the MetaTrader platform you are using is active. This means if the platform is ever closed locally on your desktop, singals will not be distributed to your Discord server. If you would like this advisor to run continuously, you will need to deploy it using a VPS. There a several examples of how to do this online, and I intend on creating a YouTube video in the future showcasing how to do so.
